# Rock_Paper_Scissors
# I creatively used the absolute difference of 2 given values to determine which player won. 
# In this way, only 3 if-statements are needed. 
# If the difference equals to 2, return a<b; if 0<difference<2, return a>b. else they are equal. 
# If the return value is true, it means player A won.
